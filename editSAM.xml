  <help>
This tool checks read alignments that are to locations other than what is
expected, given the primers removed from the read. It compares the regions
corresponding to where the primers would have bound at that alternative site
to the actual primer sequences (see *Primer matching score* below). All such
alternative mappings (primary and secondary) that are judged as not legitimate
are removed from the SAM file.

In addition, if a secondary mapping to the expected location is equivalent
(based on alignment score) to the primary mapping, the secondary map is
promoted to primary. This is because both Bowtie2 and BWA, when they find two
(or more) equivalent maps for a read, randomly choose one as primary. This
tool selects the expected location as the primary map, in order to provide
consistency to the SAM file. Of course, this does not mean that the read
definitely originated from this location as opposed to the alternative.

This tool can further edit the SAM file for length-variant realignments
(see below).

-----

**Length-variant realignments**

This tool uses the alignment output from the tool *Align length-variant reads*.
It begins by throwing out some realignments -- external in/del artifacts (see
*External in/dels* below), and those that have too many substitutions
(this evaluation is based on Bowtie2's default end-to-end alignment score
threshold [-0.6*length - 0.6] and is not parameterized -- cf. lines 192-201 of
filterSAM.pl).

Each remaining realignment, if not identical to the corresponding read mapping
already in the SAM file, is added to the SAM. It is labeled as the primary
map if it is better than the previous primary map, with respect to the number of
substitutions (or if it is equal and external -- see *External in/dels* below).
Otherwise, it is listed as a secondary map.

Each realignment's SAM record lists a mapping quality of 255 ("unavailable"),
and the alignment score (AS) is calculated as the number of substitutions
multiplied by -5, minus 1 for the in/del (regardless of the actual length).

The output realignment log file gives counts for each length variant. Each
realignment is classified into one of the following categories::

  Better         Realignment is better than original map
  New            Realignment is good; read was originally unmapped
  ExternalInDel  Realignment has an external in/del that was judged to be an artifact
  Invalid        Realignment has too many substitutions
  Worse          Realignment is worse than original map
  Same/Equiv     Realignment has the same in/del as the original map
  Filtered       Read does not appear in SAM file

-----

**External in/dels**

Insertions or deletions that appear at the 5' or 3' end of a read are called
*external*. External in/dels may be an artifact of a PCR primer mispriming on
a similar sequence near the expected location. For this reason, the tool
*Align length-variant reads* evaluates external in/dels for such a primer
match and reports the score (see *Primer matching score* below) in the
alignment output file.

This tool will throw out a realignment with an external in/del if the
primer match score is above the specified threshold and thus high enough to
explain the length variant as an artifact.

Legitimate realignments of reads with external in/dels are given precedence
over equivalent mappings in the original mapping file. This is because
external in/dels are unlikely to lead to variant calls by a conventional
approach. With an external deletion, the gap would not be apparent to a read
aligner, and an external insertion may be a matching repeat.

-----

**Primer matching score**

To evaluate whether a primer is likely to bind to a given DNA segment, the
following weighted scoring function was developed. The last 20 bases of the
primer are numbered 1-20, with #20 at the 3' end. Each base is valued
according to its position::

  Position   Value
    1-10     2*pos
   11-19     3*pos
     20      5*pos
   other       1

The values of the matches between the primer and the DNA segment are summed
and divided by the sum of the values of all positions. This gives the
score, on a scale of 0-1, with 1 representing a perfect match.

Primers shorter than 20bp are numbered to leave off the lower positions
(e.g. an 18bp primer is numbered 3-20). Primers longer than 20bp have all
positions upstream of the last 20bp valued at 1.

For example::

  primer  ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACG
  genome  TGGTACTTAGGGACGCACGTGCG
            **** ** * *** **** **

The score of this primer match is 483 / 618 = 0.782.
