  <help>
This tool stitches paired-end reads together. It requires two input FASTQ
files that list the reads in the same order. It attempts to align the reads,
given the minimum overlap and maximum mismatch parameters.

When an optimal alignment is found, a single consensus sequence is created.
The sequence begins at the position of 5' end of the first read and ends at
the 5' end of the second read. Where the reads overlap, the quality score of
each base is given by the higher of the two. When the reads disagree on the
nucleotide at a given position, the base with the higher quality score is
used. If they disagree but have the same quality score, the base that is
closer to the 5' end of its read is used.

For example, given the following paired-end reads::

  @read1 1
  ACGTTAGAA
  +
  HHHHHHHHH

  @read1 2
  AGTTCTTAC
  +
  FFFFFFFFF

the optimal alignment is::

  ACGTTAGAA
    GTAAGAACT  (reverse-complemented)
  HHHHHHHHH
    FFFFFFFFF

and the stitched read is::

  @read1
  ACGTTAGAACT
  +
  HHHHHHHHHFF

**Output File Options**

The user has the option of producing output files in addition to the default
("stitched reads"). The "stitch failures" files list the reads that were not
stitched, in their original form. The log file lists each read analyzed,
followed by the length of the overlap (or "n/a" for stitch failures), the
length of the stitched read, and the mismatch fraction. The dovetail log file
lists the overhanging 3' end(s) of each read whose optimal alignment was
dovetailed (see below).

-----

**Dovetailed Reads**

Reads derived from DNA segments that are longer than each paired-end read
will contain overhanging 3' ends. The same may be true of reads whose pair has
been truncated. The overhanging 3' ends will prevent the reads from being
joined by other programs. This tool will consider "dovetailed" alignments
with overhanging 3' ends if that option is selected. The ends of the stitched
read are still defined by the 5' ends of the reads. So the alignment::

    ACGTTAGAA
  TAACGTTAG

would result in the stitched read::

  @read1
  ACGTTAG

-----

**Ambiguous Bases (N)**

This tool counts ambiguous bases as neither matches nor mismatches.
For example::

  TGAACTTCGGG
  TGCACTNCGGG

This alignment is considered to be 10bp in length (11bp, minus 1 for the N),
with 1 mismatch (A>C; the T>N does not count). It would be rejected if the
minimum overlap parameter were greater than 10, or if the allowed mismatches
parameter were less than 0.10.
