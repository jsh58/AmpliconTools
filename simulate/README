This set of scripts is designed to simulate reads derived from amplicon-based
targeted resequencing.

The run.sh script executes the entire pipeline using a pre-selected set of
parameters.  It requires that ipcress (part of exonerate 2.4.0) be installed and
available on the command-line.  It is run by the following command:

   $ bash run.sh  <BED>  <GEN>  [<VAR>]

where

   <BED> is the file listing the locations of the PCR primers used for targeting,
           in BED format;
   <GEN> is the reference genome, in FASTA format;
   <VAR> [optional] is the file specifying variants to be made in the simulated
           reads.

For convenience, a sample <BED> file and two sample <VAR> files are provided.
Choosing different parameters can be accomplished by editing the run.sh script.

A word of warning: ipcress is very computationally expensive, in terms of time
and memory usage.  One may wish to use a limited number of amplicons, or decrease
the allowed number of mismatches ('mis', line 45) for the ipcress search.
